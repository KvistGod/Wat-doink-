I was an atheist
until I realized
I am God

I couldn’t live without you bed
because of how soft you are
when on your pillow I lay my head
you take me on a trip so far

When I’m tired you’re there for me
you hold me up and let me sleep
even when I’m just lazy
you will me in you keep

Sometimes you give me a nightmare
it scares me and it wakes me up
that’s okay cause I don’t care
cause I know you had it stop

So after all you’re really great
and I rate you eight out of eight
